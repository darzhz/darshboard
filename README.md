## ⚙️ Key Technical Decisions

- **React Grid Layout** was used over alternatives like `react-mosaic` for its maturity, flexibility, and easy integration.
- **Drizzle ORM** was selected for its type safety and native Next.js API route support, making it easier to reason about schema and queries.
- **Persistent Layouts** are stored in the database to ensure consistency across sessions and devices.
- **Component-Driven Widgets** allow the app to scale modularly—each widget is a plug-and-play React component.

## 🧩 Challenges Faced & Solutions

### 1. **Preserving Layout State Across Sessions**
   - *Challenge:* Making sure widget position and size persisted correctly for every user and session.
   - *Solution:* Stored serialized layouts in the database with Drizzle, updating via API on layout changes.

### 2. **Optimizing React Grid Layout for Mobile Devices**
   - *Challenge:* Grid items didn’t behave well on smaller screens.
   - *Solution:* Tweaked `cols` and `breakpoints` settings, and used a mobile-first approach for layout configs.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/darzhz/darshboard.git
cd darshboard
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
We are using **React 19**, which is still quite new.Because of this, if you run a simple `npm i`, you might encounter some dependency errors.  
To fix it, you can install dependencies by running either:

```bash
npm i --force
```
or
```bash
npm i --legacy-peer-deps
```

This forces npm to bypass or relax strict version checks so that everything installs smoothly.

---
### 3. Configure the Database

Create a `.env` file in the root:

```env
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/darshboard
JWT_SECRET="Thisissupersecret123"
NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

Then push the schema using Drizzle:

```bash
npx drizzle-kit push
```

### 4. Run the Dev Server

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Your dashboard should now be live at `http://localhost:3000`

## ➕ Adding New Widgets

1. Create a new widget in `src/components/widgets/`
2. Register it in the layout object
3. Set default size and position
